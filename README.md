# Intelligent-Reverse-Braking-System
Intelligent reverse braking system using Artificial Neural Networks

Trained a neural network using Back-propagation Algorithm to predict the percentage of brake pressure to be applied 
as per the input from proximity sensor installed on the body of car.

Coded back-propagation algorithm from scratch in python.
